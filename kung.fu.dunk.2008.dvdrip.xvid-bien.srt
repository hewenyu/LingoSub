1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,465
Who controls the rebound, wins the match...

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,576
as who had a left hook,
that would move a tank.

3
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,948
However...

4
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,769
slam dunk make me feel good.

5
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,844
To a kindhearted person.

6
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,273
Big Brother,

7
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,349
I found this baby by chance.

8
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,987
I can only leave it to you.

9
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,087
But I feel my fate
is connected to this child.

10
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,886
Here, count this as its present to you.

11
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,392
I can't read.

12
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,228
You can read. Please teach him this.

13
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,494
'Faltering Universe...'

14
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,170
For God's sake! It's 'Altering Universe'

15
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,444
So it is...

16
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,143
He's born for martial arts.

17
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,812
Is he? So, please look after him.

18
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,784
Goodbye.

19
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,255
Jump!

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,825
Your Lightness Kung Fu has improved a lot!

21
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,693
Next time you wanna jump,

22
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,259
please put some shoes on.

23
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,468
The world was divided into Heaven and Earth
when 'Qiqn and Kun' were created.

24
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,937
Every life form originated
from Yin and Yang.

25
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,912
All changes in life forms in this world'

26
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,008
are related to 'Qi

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,180
Master, I don't get it.

28
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,646
Everything in this world
is made of tiny particles.

29
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:12,153
'Altering Universe'
disassembles those particles,

30
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,050
taking everything apart,

31
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,328
then rebuilds it.

32
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,362
In a split second,

33
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,056
time is stopped.

34
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,428
You can even turn the clock back.

35
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,864
Master

36
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,234
Master

37
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,206
Master

38
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,382
Can anyone help my Master?

39
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,778
Any one?

40
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,481
Master!

41
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,281
Master!

42
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,460
Master...

43
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:06,870
My name is Fang Shijie.

44
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,707
I grew up in this Kung Fu school.

45
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,533
My Master told me

46
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,575
I was found next to a basketball court.

47
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,046
Now,

48
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,683
whenever I hear the sound of ball thumping,

49
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,376
my heartbeat increases...

50
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,180
It's not a heart attack.

51
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,992
It's because I will see her there.

52
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,504
I'm too old for love affairs...

53
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,543
But speaking of my love life,

54
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,344
it's been very eventful.

55
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,609
You see, in my life,

56
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,339
there have been 3 girls
who would die for me.

57
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,717
When I first discovered love,

58
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,682
there was a girl who would die for me...

59
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,746
If you keep stalking me,

60
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,183
I'll kill myself.

61
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,824
When I was an adolescent,

62
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,457
there was a girl who would wait for me
until the next life.

63
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,791
Wanna be my boyfriend?

64
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,893
Wait till your next life!

65
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,828
When I was poor and lonely,

66
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,640
there was a girl who would die with me.

67
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,399
If you don't give me the money back...

68
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,478
I'll jump from here with you!

69
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,758
This is a Kung Fu school.

70
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,328
Sure you can tell that?

71
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,764
This is where I grew up.

72
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,935
Technically speaking,

73
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,674
since my Master died from attempting
'Altering Universe',

74
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,608
I've become ever more defiant.

75
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,776
They're Master Fei and Master Wu.

76
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,412
The traditions of Shaolin and Wudang
have been passed on

77
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,380
from one generation to the other.
They're the masters of the 88th

78
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,217
and the 99th generations of the schools.

79
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,798
They are a couple,

80
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,605
Master Ni and Master Huang.

81
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,409
Oh, right,

82
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,667
they were pen pals before.

83
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,808
Good day! Headmaster!

84
00:07:59,011 --> 00:07:59,670
There is someone else at the school

85
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,847
who you should know...

86
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,306
He's the so-called 'World No. 1 Fist God'

87
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,983
Our Headmaster - Wang Biao.

88
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,040
Everyone saw?

89
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,848
In the world of martial arts...

90
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,145
This is my job...

91
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,480
Headmaster's human punch bag.

92
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,647
But his fists are so weak,

93
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,254
as long as I put on my iron vest,

94
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,752
it doesn't hurt at all.

95
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,623
How many times have I told you?

96
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,465
Never put on the iron vest
when I punch you!

97
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,767
Here is your punishment: no dinner.

98
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,601
And get out!

99
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,534
Get out!

100
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,362
It's getting late. You're not going home?

101
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,663
I'm locked out.

102
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,069
Wanna sleep here overnight?

103
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,277
Yeah, why not?

104
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,509
Of course not!

105
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,479
Why not?

106
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:24,775
Why not?

107
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,481
I can tell you didn't eat anything.

108
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,710
And if you didn't eat anything,
you can't go to bed.

109
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,618
I'm not hungry.

110
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,654
I think you are but you have no money.

111
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,093
Here.

112
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:39,557
No. Thanks.

113
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,823
Hey, it's not for you.

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,167
It's for a bet.

115
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,360
If you can throw this coin into my mouth,

116
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,001
I'll treat you to dinner.

117
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,636
Surely not from such close range.

118
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,343
Not too far either.

119
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,607
Here is fine.

120
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,262
I'm good, right?

121
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,741
French cuisine! Wanna eat?

122
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,633
It's so expensive!

123
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,104
So that shows I'm sincere!

124
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,681
Come on, we're VIPs.

125
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,882
We have a special entrance. Follow me!

126
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,087
Wei, Hua and Fa!

127
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,786
Cool!

128
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,327
You know it's mealtime, right?

129
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,424
Come on...

130
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,591
They're cool!

131
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,360
They're on their home turf here.

132
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,059
But like me,

133
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,295
they don't want to go home.

134
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,671
I count myself as their patron.

135
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,369
And I have a patron as well.

136
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,047
Bao!

137
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,783
Dad!

138
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,951
My daughter, Bao.

139
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,054
Does she look like me?

140
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,251
Sadly... she doesn't.

141
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,549
She looks like her mum.

142
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,623
thought you weren't coming today.

143
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,454
Of course I'm coming.

144
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,790
We have a guest today.

145
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,590
Two set dinners!

146
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,699
Hmm...

147
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,341
Hmm... okay.

148
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,908
Let's have escargots for a starter.

149
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,313
There are lots left over.

150
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,581
And steaks as well.

151
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,724
Come on, cheers!

152
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,261
A '92 topped with a '94?

153
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,698
Wow, Dad, you're so good at tasting wine!

154
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,236
It's mixed with '92, '94 and '96.

155
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,408
Leftovers from 3 tables.

156
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,110
People choose a wine by the year,
but I go for the whole decade!

157
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,941
All the best wines of the '90s!

158
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,247
Try some escargots.

159
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,212
Take your time.
I need to check if the customers have left.

160
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,616
Come on, cheers! Here's to our grand plan!

161
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,812
Cheers.

162
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,926
What plan?

163
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,326
My grand plan means 'Two swords in One'.

164
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,360
Your athletic potential combined
with my brain.

165
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,043
Look at the colour of it,

166
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,478
isn't it great?

167
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,605
It tastes even better.

168
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,745
Almost the best whiskey
of the 21 st century.

169
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,683
Try it.

170
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,068
Hmm... it tastes really good.

171
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,065
Of course!

172
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,806
It's more than 1 000 dollars
cheaper than the real thing.

173
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,940
But the guests can never tell
what's good or bad.

174
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,068
Pricey booze is always good.

175
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,175
Brother Hu,

176
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,613
some idiot wants to bet on darts!

177
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,642
200 dollars for a round!

178
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,848
You know, I never lose in a darts game.

179
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,421
If we fill the bottles

180
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,127
with the fake whisky,

181
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,165
no one will ever know.

182
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,036
How about 70% for me and 30% for you?

183
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,805
Okay?

184
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,333
Brother Hu, can I have another 200 dollars?

185
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,010
How is this possible? You never lose!

186
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,074
I'll definitely win this time.

187
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,891
I'm being very fair...

188
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,466
One for you, another one for me...

189
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,670
One for me, one for me again
and another one for you...

190
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,104
I was wondering who would be your champion!

191
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,243
Hu!

192
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:29,381
Ah, I forgot we were on your turf!

193
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,747
Let's pretend it never happened,

194
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,523
alright?

195
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,260
You stole my money

196
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,787
and now you're giving it back to me.

197
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,591
What does this mean?

198
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,332
Do you remember

199
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,566
I was a good friend of your dad's?

200
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,066
I held you in my arms

201
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,832
and you peed on me...

202
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,876
Jie, come on,
don't forget we need to meet someone.

203
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,145
Come on, let's go...

204
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,344
You can have ice cream somewhere else!

205
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,989
Come on, quick, let's go...

206
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,189
Let's go!

207
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,491
Jie, let's go!

208
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,058
'85? No wonder it's so good!

209
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,431
Beat him to death!

210
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,976
Surround him!

211
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,107
Have you decided yet?

212
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,443
Can we open the window?

213
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,653
We have to keep our meeting a secret.

214
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,617
All doors and windows have to be shut

215
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,918
until we've finished.

216
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,920
Okay, let me tell you.

217
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,661
We can never agree to a merger.

218
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,456
Ah... you're not listening to me...

219
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,556
Never listening to me...

220
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,432
I bet you won't give up
until the last nail is in the coffin?

221
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,183
Look at these big fat gold bars.

222
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,449
Enough to make up your mind?

223
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,013
The price of gold is going up.

224
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,522
It's worth more than 10 million.

225
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,021
It's all yours.

226
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,157
Last night,

227
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,596
a student of ours
was making trouble in a nightclub.

228
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,672
It's seriously damaged
the reputation of our school.

229
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,340
I hoped he'd come out and admit it.

230
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,612
Who did it? Step forward!

231
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,616
What have I taught you?

232
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,317
A decent man should be responsible
for what he's done.

233
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:19,834
Well, I'll count to 3.

234
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,540
If no one steps forward,

235
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,673
I'll expel you all!

236
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,312
One!

237
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,818
Two...

238
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,803
Thanks...

239
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,100
It was him!

240
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,704
Enough?

241
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,909
It's okay. He's really tough.

242
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,344
No... my hit men are tired.

243
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,450
Sure, sure, they must be tired.

244
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,916
I'll treat them to dinner tonight.

245
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,337
You never learned.
Now, you've ruined our reputation.

246
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,573
Now,

247
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,012
you're expelled!

248
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,272
Hey, Hey!

249
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,449
Ah, I was just about to talk to you.

250
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:21,980
I've done my research...

251
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,887
What suits you most is...

252
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,290
What's wrong?

253
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,391
Can you take me to the club?

254
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,824
I want them to pay the price...

255
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,128
You think you're Bruce Lee?

256
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,029
Forget about the nonsense.

257
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,003
Let's do something grand!

258
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:45,965
I can't play football.

259
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,537
How about basketball?

260
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,442
Come on, throw it into that trash can.

261
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,313
Come on, give it a try!

262
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,255
YES

263
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,127
Playing basketball
is not just about winning.

264
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,195
If he plays basketball in order
to search for his birth parents,

265
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,423
isn't it more touching?

266
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,128
See, his audience have tears
in their eyes...

267
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,736
They cheer him throughout the match...

268
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,338
Won't it make the headlines?

269
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,304
Stop it

270
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,542
Abandoned by his parents,

271
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,071
he plays basketball
while searching for them...

272
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,944
It'll be a moving, sensational story.

273
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,279
Even if he's not winning,

274
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,108
the University will still
get lots of publicity.

275
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,916
Chancellor Zhou, look at him.

276
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,247
How innocent!

277
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,057
He's not only an obedient son,

278
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,757
but a role model for young people.

279
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,892
Because he's raised the athletic spirit

280
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,399
to a higher level.

281
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,300
He's showed us

282
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,768
the virtues of Chinese culture.

283
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,673
We all know
how important parents are to us:

284
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,976
Fang will keep playing basketball
until he finds his parents.

285
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,478
Let us welcome

286
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,314
Fang Shijie - the Basketball Orphan

287
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,151
who loves his parents so much
he'll never stop looking for them.

288
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,950
Fang Shijie

289
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,870
Do I have to dress like this?

290
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,047
You look cool, come on...

291
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,549
Read from the notes.

292
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,818
Thank you all for your support. Thank...

293
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:49,997
my dear Uncle Li,
and the Chancellor. I'll...

294
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,771
I hope... I can find my parents soon.

295
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,762
I'll work hard...

296
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:56,872
Wait a minute!

297
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,143
No one can join our team

298
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,216
without the Captain's permission.

299
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:12,919
Who is she?

300
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,717
That's the basketball team.

301
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,721
We do have this tradition.

302
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,532
Well, since there are
so many journalists here,

303
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,233
Let Jie demonstrate...

304
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,627
come on, no problem,

305
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,394
Even the Chancellor has to observe

306
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,937
the traditions of the First University.

307
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,608
Whether Fang Shijie
can join the team depends on...

308
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,777
They still can't find him...

309
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:33,841
The Captain's name is Ding Wei,

310
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,706
20 years old, 4th grade

311
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,478
As long as he can score one,
he'll be admitted...

312
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,151
It's still not certain whether

313
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,842
Fang Shijie can join the team...

314
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,828
Well, miss,

315
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,194
getting scared?

316
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,060
Hiding isn't a good idea.

317
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,834
Is any one answering?

318
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,408
Shall I ask Jie to shoot?

319
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,013
He scores each time

320
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,700
Here you are!

321
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,868
Someone is waiting for your permission
to join the team.

322
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,937
He's the Captain?

323
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,506
How is he going to play if he's drunk?

324
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,310
Here he is.

325
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,242
YA!

326
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,332
Shoot! Shoot!

327
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,624
Get back, please.

328
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,324
Sorry, get back, please.

329
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,101
Yes, please, get back.

330
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,377
YA!

331
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,780
Did you read the papers today?

332
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,155
A true life story of 'Oliver Twist'

333
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,550
Isn't it wonderful?

334
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,855
We're going to make a fortune!

335
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,588
Okay, that's it. Don't worry.

336
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,430
Okay, bye!

337
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,358
What's wrong?

338
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,898
What the hell! Such big coverage!

339
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,266
It's not right, look...

340
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,137
'Basketball Orphan Bullied by Captain'

341
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,471
Fantastic headline!

342
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,908
Very sensational! You don't like it?

343
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,742
Stop selling stories to journalists!

344
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,051
What do you know about it?

345
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,019
You're neither Yao Ming nor Liu Xiang.

346
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,656
They don't have to say anything but
they'll always be in the headlines!

347
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,382
But you're nobody.

348
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,651
You know you're nobody?

349
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,294
No one would write about you.
You'll never get any exposure.

350
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,793
Unless you can spice up the story.

351
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,226
They don't care about you!

352
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,229
It's a sensational headline.
A story to tell!

353
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,196
Ah, I see...

354
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,068
You're worried you'll be bullied

355
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,703
when others read the story?

356
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,639
Well, that's for sure,

357
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,279
because you're a genius.

358
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,616
People are always jealous of geniuses.

359
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,609
It doesn't matter.
As long as you're famous!

360
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,344
You can have anything when you're famous.

361
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,045
That's how things work.

362
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,019
Come on, go practice.

363
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,959
Come on, be good and go.

364
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,343
Captain,

365
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,510
I know you're gutted.

366
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,478
It's fine if you want to beat me up,

367
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,180
I won't fight back.

368
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,783
Who said I wanted to beat you up?

369
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,930
There is a saying
amongst basketball players.

370
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,234
'He who controls the rebounds,

371
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,873
wins the match'

372
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,205
You can jump really high.

373
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,573
So you just do

374
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,541
one thing in the match -

375
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,114
rebound.

376
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,606
That's boring!

377
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,939
I'm good at shooting.

378
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,207
Never miss one.

379
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,392
Morning!

380
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,798
Why stopped? Keep playing!

381
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,579
Wow, are you okay, brother?

382
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,981
Sure you're not sick?

383
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,740
It's too early to show up!

384
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,246
I've found a secret weapon.

385
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,821
What secret weapon?

386
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,153
Brother, your time has come!

387
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,413
We'll be the winners at the championship!

388
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,883
That's impossible.

389
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,158
Top 3?

390
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,594
Stop dreaming!

391
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,264
Then, top 8?

392
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,935
Possibly.

393
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,438
Possibly.

394
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,473
Come on, shoot!

395
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,677
Come on, shoot!

396
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,243
Cool!

397
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,516
Hello!

398
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,275
I'm Zhen Li,

399
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,317
the agent of the Basketball Orphan,
Fang Shijie.

400
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,119
I'd like to send some photos to you.
Can I have the address?

401
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,321
Okay, thank you.

402
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,830
Xiao Lan! Xiao Lan... please sign for us...

403
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,158
Can you write my name on?

404
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,432
Can you take a picture with us?

405
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,966
So excited!

406
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,766
Work hard, Xiao Lan...

407
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,247
Hey, this is Jie.
He's so good at shooting hoops.

408
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,679
- Jie. - Lily

409
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:28,888
This is Xiao Lan.

410
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,249
This is Fang Shijie.

411
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,024
He got injured and just came back today.

412
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:36,926
Hello!

413
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,290
Lily's mentioned you to me.

414
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,903
She says you're very talented.

415
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,533
Really?

416
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,773
But the most important is
what you learn from the training.

417
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,309
Lily also says you lack basic training.

418
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,547
So you're saying you can beat him?

419
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,680
Try it, if you have the guts.

420
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,150
You know who the hero is? It's Jie!

421
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:58,848
Right?

422
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,777
Why are you clapping?
The journalists are here.

423
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,208
Stop clapping.

424
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,564
Did you get my point or not?

425
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,369
Know who the hero is?

426
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,297
You mean Jie?

427
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,200
Of course!

428
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,636
He's new.

429
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,069
He should be on the bench for a while.

430
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,267
On the damn bench?!
He's been waiting all day.

431
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,741
Come on.

432
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,850
What did she say?

433
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:01,977
She said she really wants to see you play.

434
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:03,685
I asked her to wait.

435
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,238
I warn you, there are only 5 minutes left.

436
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,380
If you don't let Jie play,
I'll call the police.

437
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,513
Put Jie on.

438
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,021
Hi, nice to meet you.

439
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,424
Oh! My God! Shoot! Shoot!

440
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,146
That's impossible. He's never missed!

441
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,188
Oh... My... God.

442
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,521
Foul! Foul!

443
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,289
Referee, it's a foul!

444
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,369
Come on, try again, no problem.

445
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,440
Cool! Right?

446
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,206
Did you see it? Did you?

447
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:12,768
Hello.

448
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,238
This is Jie, have you eaten?

449
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,579
Jie, it's so nice to talk to you.

450
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,442
Really?

451
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,348
Tell you what. There is a pervert.

452
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,952
He's been standing downstairs
for more than an hour.

453
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:25,917
A pervert?

454
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,725
I've called my brother.

455
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:30,686
- He should be here soon.
- Hello,

456
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,692
the battery is going... hello...

457
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,422
Damn it! Run!

458
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,696
Hello!

459
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,316
Jie.

460
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:02,978
Where is the ball?

461
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,325
Captain, I've been practicing for ages,

462
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:15,856
can you teach me how to slamdunk?

463
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,898
Do you want to run before you can walk?

464
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,301
Take your time!

465
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,009
Is it really that difficult to dunk?

466
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,350
I know Lightness Kung Fu...

467
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,152
Hmm... so it can't be that difficult.

468
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,852
The starting line-up
of the First University:

469
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,320
Captain Ding Wei, Shooting Guard Zhang Gui

470
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,356
Center Yang Rong, Power Forward Xiao Lan.

471
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,059
And the popular 'Basketball Orphan'...

472
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,695
Never seen you before. Are you new?

473
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,125
Yeah, nice to meet you.

474
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,462
This game is cruel.
It's never nice to meet you.

475
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:25,869
Only screaming and whining here.

476
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,866
They scream for me:

477
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,561
Oh! You're so cool!

478
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,568
You whine:

479
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,900
Oh! I'm so embarrassed!

480
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,039
It's a cruel world.

481
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,612
Jump ball!

482
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,990
Fang Shijie takes the ball
and passes to Xiao Lan.

483
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,217
Xiao Lan dunks! Fantastic!

484
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,626
This match has attracted
mass media attention.

485
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,561
Fang's search for his parents
has become the hottest topic.

486
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,800
Fang steals the ball

487
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,704
and passes to the Captain Ding.

488
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,901
Ding jams it in again!

489
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,176
But it's a pity that he can't dunk.

490
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,086
The ball is passed to Fang and he shoots...

491
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,153
It's impossible...

492
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,182
But he scored!

493
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,919
Did you see it?

494
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,554
He never misses! Crazy!

495
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:35,867
Fang has the ball...

496
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,369
He sheds the defense.

497
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,602
He looks like Michael Jordan in his prime!

498
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,375
Beautiful!

499
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,442
Xiao Lan's dunk has really
brought the game to a fever pitch!

500
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,249
Dunk! Fang Shijie!

501
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,947
Slammmmm Dunk! Another dunk!

502
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,193
Dunk... Dunk...

503
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:07,099
Dunk... Dunk...

504
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,200
- Fang's got the ball
- Dunk...

505
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,069
- and the crowd is going wild
- Dunk...

506
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,505
Dunk! Dunk!

507
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,311
Dunk! Dunk! Fang's going to dunk!

508
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,273
Never give your opponent a chance.

509
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,609
The mighty guards
of the First University...

510
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:22,080
It represents

511
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,810
the long history and traditions
of the First University Basketball Team.

512
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,416
Jordan, Kobe and Magic Johnson:

513
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:26,953
at this moment,
their spirits have come to Fang.

514
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:27,816
Fang Shijie is now representing

515
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:28,992
the long history and traditions

516
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,524
of the First University Basketball Team.

517
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,130
At this moment, he's not fighting alone.

518
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,992
He scored!

519
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,561
The almighty
First University Basketball Team!

520
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,033
Happy Birthday to Fang!

521
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,140
Long Live Fang!

522
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:18,639
Come, have some water.

523
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,275
Thanks.

524
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,138
Tired?

525
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:27,982
Ah, sorry!

526
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,081
You played so well!

527
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,919
Everyone was watching you.
You're the soul of the team.

528
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,420
You're terrific!

529
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,917
Keeping working. Work hard!

530
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,131
When suits you?

531
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,528
Next March.

532
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,928
Then how about 1.3 million dollars?

533
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,133
Can it be cheaper?

534
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,372
Hello! Yes, yes.

535
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,035
I'll arrange the interview for you.

536
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,277
Okay, no problem.

537
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,193
I don't want to be your enemy.

538
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,425
I hope you can leave
the First University and join us.

539
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,027
Who are you?

540
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,660
I'll be your opponent
the day after tomorrow.

541
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,461
We'll be opponents

542
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,897
in the Championship the day after tomorrow.

543
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,534
That's good. Nice to meet you.

544
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,502
I've been watching you for a while.

545
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,477
You shoot well; even from a long distance.

546
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,442
Shoot! The ball always goes in.

547
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,349
But your weakness is that
whenever you're distracted,

548
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:47,590
you miss.

549
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,024
This is my name card.

550
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,660
I can help you improve.

551
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,069
Captain of the Fire Ball?

552
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,873
Yes, that's right. Call me.

553
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:08,845
Think it over.

554
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,677
Hello! Long time no see!

555
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,154
What're you doing here?

556
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,522
I came to see you;
to catch up with you, couldn't I?

557
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,426
Wow!

558
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,962
Great! All our old friends are here.

559
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,707
See you in the match
the day after tomorrow.

560
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,121
Hello! What?

561
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,379
Big business!

562
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,118
That's right, it's me.

563
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,179
Hey... His name is Li Tian.

564
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,316
He joined our team two years ago.

565
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,726
Same as you, he was no good at first.

566
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,926
But he was very talented.

567
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,790
He picked up everything so quickly.

568
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,095
And be the skipper quickly

569
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,624
But he changed completely after a while.

570
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,065
He not only left the team
on the eve of the final match

571
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,362
But also took the best players with him.

572
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,831
It must be really hard for you
that I'm always on top.

573
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,468
Actually,
I was 'on top' of your girlfriend as well.

574
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,282
They were neck-and-neck in the final.

575
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,012
There were 2 seconds left and
the First University was 1 point behind.

576
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,421
But my brother was
going to shoot 2 freethrows.

577
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:04,890
Yo! She was good...

578
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,497
YES

579
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,627
My brother was on the brink
of a nervous breakdown.

580
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,864
From the moment the ball was thrown,

581
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,768
every one knew the result.

582
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,401
At that crucial moment,

583
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,338
the most fearsome enemy appeared:

584
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,209
it was his own trembling hands!

585
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,347
After that match,

586
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,279
my brother could never get over the trauma.

587
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,009
He consoles himself with hard drinking.

588
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,857
Don't worry.
I won't let Li Tien get away with it.

589
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,956
But... I'm worried
Uncle Li might sell you out.

590
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,299
No way. It's impossible.

591
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,356
Uncle Li...

592
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,395
Jie, don't fall into the trap!

593
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,698
If you fight them,
you won't be allowed to play the match.

594
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,638
You're the dream and ambition of my life.

595
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,180
They just didn't get it.

596
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,281
How could it be possible for me
to sell my dream?

597
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,452
Thank you.

598
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,522
What for?

599
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,787
I'll never sell off my cash cow...

600
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,297
but the price is damned tempting...

601
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,467
Please,

602
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,171
work hard and be successful.

603
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,503
Don't let me regret my decision tonight.

604
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:06,840
I won't let you down.

605
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,980
I recognize them. All are hooligans.

606
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,022
They were banned from all matches in Japan.

607
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,499
You get scared to death when you see me

608
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,304
My desire to win is so strong

609
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,480
You cut it! You pass it!

610
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,841
Run! If you're as fast as me

611
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,609
Your goosebumps
are falling in my spicy hot pot

612
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,477
Ha! My happiness

613
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,449
is built upon your failure

614
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,313
You're still being indecisive

615
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,046
The basketball court
is the battlefield and we fight

616
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,554
Everyone is tough on the crime scene

617
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,282
It's made of iron,
can you shield yourself from it?

618
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,427
Are you up to the real challenge?

619
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,459
I fight for my pride

620
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,823
I fight for the excitement

621
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,498
Hey, two weeks ago,

622
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,292
in the game against the Warriors,
you dunked...

623
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,693
Didn't I look just like you?

624
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:40,901
You'd die with them

625
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,731
Your dreams are shattered, and then?

626
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,065
All you family and friends
have lost their faces

627
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,741
Your basketball career has come to an end

628
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,136
Are you still struggling?

629
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,335
The answer is correct
and the same each time

630
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:50,638
Come to the basketball court
if you have guts

631
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,280
I'll crush you to death

632
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,417
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

633
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,950
Our spirit is so high
that makes you shake with fear

634
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,712
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

635
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:00,947
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

636
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,715
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

637
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,522
Excuse me.

638
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,620
Hey, remember two weeks ago,

639
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,897
3.25 pm, you dunked...

640
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,923
But I don't want to copy you,
hitting my head against the backboard.

641
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,663
What can you do then?

642
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,337
Captain!

643
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,410
Are you okay?

644
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,016
Careful.

645
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,482
Get him off.

646
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,430
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

647
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,967
Our spirit is so high that
makes you shake with fear

648
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,638
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

649
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:23,863
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

650
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,540
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

651
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,677
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

652
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,369
Our spirit is so high that
makes you shake with fear

653
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,014
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

654
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,274
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

655
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,247
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

656
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,195
This is the foul
you played against my teammates

657
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,260
just one minute ago.

658
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,358
You're not the only one with a good memory.

659
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,400
Do whatever you like.
You're bound to loose.

660
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,587
Beautiful! Good!

661
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,372
Replacing?

662
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,771
Hey, we've signed the agreement.

663
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,278
The agreement is the same as the contract.

664
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,342
Of course not!
The game isn't finished yet...

665
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:42,618
Hello? Hello...

666
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,595
Ladies and Gentlemen,
as a result of the power cut,

667
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,196
the match is abandoned.

668
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,466
The committee has decided...

669
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,331
- Count yourselves lucky!
- the match will be resumed...

670
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,631
- in three days.
- But you're going to lose...

671
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,568
sooner or later.

672
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,641
It doesn't matter when. Take a break.

673
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,446
I can't help if God is on our side...

674
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,008
Is this your bad luck or my good fortune?

675
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,586
Bye!

676
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:24,555
Let's go!

677
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,097
What have you been daydreaming
about all afternoon?

678
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,931
Nothing. I'm thinking of my parents.

679
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,474
It seemed like they came to the match.

680
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:41,908
Did you see them?

681
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:43,844
I could feel them there.

682
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,547
It's strange...

683
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,376
If they were here,
why didn't they come to me first?

684
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,782
Yeah, you're right.

685
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,243
Still remember me?

686
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,207
What? Looking for a fight?

687
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,680
Brother Hu.

688
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,279
I'm not looking for a fight.

689
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,853
The match the other day.

690
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,951
I caused the power cut.

691
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,423
So, it was you...

692
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,692
But why?

693
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,924
To be honest, I left Bi Tianhao.

694
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,725
I must beat him.

695
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,501
So I put a bet on you.

696
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:43,130
How much?

697
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,966
5 million US dollars.

698
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,386
Jie,

699
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,394
Look, who is here?

700
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:11,556
I saw you on TV. You looked cool!

701
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:12,427
Why are you all here?

702
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,159
Have you found your parents?

703
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,396
No, not yet.

704
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:19,735
Jie, searching for your parents
via basketball...

705
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,068
That's a good gimmick.

706
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,675
It's better than a soap opera.

707
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,310
You're in the paper every day.

708
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:25,681
They don't believe...

709
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,109
- I am your master.
Yes.

710
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,683
I guess you must have
heard Jie's news on TV,

711
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,079
I'm hoping you could do a favour for Jie.

712
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:33,583
Play a Kung Fu basketball match for him.

713
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,692
Jie is our best protege.

714
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,692
His business is our business, right?

715
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:41,795
Yes, sure.

716
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,665
As long as it's legal,

717
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,335
I was open to anything that would help him.

718
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,728
Say thank you to your Master.

719
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:49,836
Didn't you hear what he said?

720
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,342
He 'was' open to anything, 'was'...

721
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:54,705
What do you mean?

722
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,046
You know Bi Tianhao took over the school.

723
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,148
To be honest, during the past years,

724
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:08,353
we've been serving that bastard Wang Biao.

725
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:09,886
We're absolutely useless.

726
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,093
It is a crappy job at the school

727
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,858
but it's my bread and butter.

728
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,427
I can't sacrifice it for a useless medal.

729
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,436
Hey, the soap opera is starting...

730
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,131
'Tales from the World of Martial Arts'

731
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,501
Hello! Yes, speaking.

732
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,907
Ah, I've no time for that...

733
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,447
I don't care which paper you write for.
I'm busy!

734
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,377
Hey, what's wrong with me?

735
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,618
Nothing. It's my problem.

736
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,359
I can't accept another woman in my life.

737
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,018
Are you crying?

738
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,159
Stop crying.

739
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,124
Leave me alone.

740
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,165
I won't.

741
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,736
Am I a nuisance?

742
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:41,605
No way.

743
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,675
You're always cheerful... you're...

744
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:48,911
What?

745
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:51,715
Nothing.

746
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:56,988
What?

747
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:00,459
Really wanna know?

748
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:01,893
Yes.

749
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:02,996
Promise you won't laugh at me.

750
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,998
I liked ice cream so much when I was a kid.

751
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,630
But I could never have it.

752
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:13,774
So I'd do anything
just to get some ice cream.

753
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,309
You're just like ice cream...

754
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,411
I knew I shouldn't have said it.

755
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,725
- He should be here soon.
- Hello,

756
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,529
Hello, the battery is going to go, hello...

757
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,928
Lily: Work hard, Jie.

758
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,659
Two cripples and two useless riff-raff,

759
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,731
it's five fighting against one.

760
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,424
- Hey, Jie.
- Master.

761
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,595
We changed our mind.

762
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,601
We decided to get our hands dirty.

763
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,167
They're not students.

764
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,739
They're not qualified.

765
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,778
Ah, they've been transferred
to the University.

766
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,375
They're absolutely qualified.

767
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,280
Ah, but they are so old!

768
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,518
'Taiji born out of Wuji'

769
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:47,045
Jie!

770
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:08,940
Come on!

771
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:12,714
Hello, Handsome.

772
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,417
Yo! Look at his muscles.

773
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:44,831
Sit down!

774
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,108
Hey... that whistle blower...

775
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,444
What a referee! He sent us off...

776
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,375
Damn! I was on a roll...

777
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,707
Not having enough fun...

778
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,346
Me too.

779
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,318
Jie, we asked you to come here

780
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,451
because we brought something for you.

781
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,167
'Jie, we saw you on TV

782
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,759
and we feel really sorry.

783
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,965
We never fulfilled
our responsibilities as parents.

784
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:19,205
Play the basketball well.

785
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,007
We'll be there for you in the audience.

786
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,773
Masters, is it really from my parents?

787
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,781
Uncle Li gave us this letter last night.

788
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,882
This is what changed our minds.

789
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:20,397
This is impossible...

790
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,402
You'd never expect that

791
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,967
we'd have recovered from the injuries.

792
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,559
Sticks of sugar-coated fruits flying out
when I kick

793
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,534
Memories spreading out
in the moonlight when I punch

794
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,174
A piece of ginger. A piece of the past

795
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,038
I can give you an autograph for a keepsake

796
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,270
I say a windshield protects us
from snow storms

797
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:06,607
A roof shields us from moonlight

798
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,941
A window should be installed
in the world of martial arts

799
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,242
A lance should be spun in a Peking Opera

800
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,011
I stand firm in the horse stance

801
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,856
I put on a Kung Fu suit
when I'm bored and tired

802
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,888
I don't sell tofu (tofu)

803
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,755
What I learn in the martial arts school
is called Kung Fu

804
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,625
Kung Fu (Kung Fu), Kung Fu (Kung Fu)

805
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:24,764
Quick, put on your Qibao

806
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,364
so I can't take advantage of you

807
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,332
You're just like tofu (tofu)

808
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,234
Your beautiful skin seduces me
when I'm practicing Kung Fu

809
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,035
Kung Fu (Kung Fu), Kung Fu (Kung Fu)

810
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,108
Quick, put on your Qibao

811
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,040
so I can't take advantage of you

812
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,952
When I kick lightly,

813
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,121
you're thrown to the edge of the world

814
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,481
If I kicked too hard,

815
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,350
there would be no world left

816
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:50,752
Flowers falling in the sunset

817
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,358
Climbing over mountains,
crossing over rivers

818
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:55,461
I clear my throat
and start to sing Peking Opera

819
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,598
Flying up to Dunhuang Going
deep into the Wild North

820
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,394
Who is there when I turn around?

821
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,466
Ah, what kind of place is it?

822
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,661
What situation is it? La, la, la...

823
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:06,466
I'll step on your shoulders
when I'm bored and tired

824
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,505
Ah, are you okay?

825
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,888
3 seconds left...

826
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:30,832
The last throw...
I leave it to you and Xiao Lan.

827
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,541
Come on, hang in there...

828
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,802
Come on, you're gonna win!

829
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,218
You're so despicable!

830
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,146
Headmaster...

831
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,880
You can jump high, right? So jump then!

832
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,887
- Are you okay?
- Smash your shin.

833
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,923
Stop your blood flow...

834
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,126
Too late to use Qigong!

835
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:04,556
Don't be afraid.

836
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,462
Everyone is watching him.
But it's your show now.

837
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,137
Jie, hang in there.

838
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:15,775
He can't jump anymore.

839
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,042
Watch out for Xiao Lan.

840
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,338
Hey, what the hell is this?

841
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,236
Hey, what the hell is this?

842
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,842
No, I'm not. I'm Bi Tianhao's...

843
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:24,376
- secret weapon.
- It's a goal-tending

844
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,941
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

845
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,646
Rules against goal tending
only apply to players.

846
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:35,680
He's the referee,
and he's disqualified as a referee.

847
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,188
But the point is - you lost!!

848
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,492
Fire Ball won!

849
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,797
Everything in this world
is made of tiny particles.

850
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:03,337
'Altering Universe'
dissembles those particles,

851
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,510
and rebuilds it.

852
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:10,307
In a split second, time is stopped.

853
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,749
You can even turn the clock back.

854
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,183
He's not throwing. He's passing the ball!

855
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,303
Now, I've finally understood

856
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,445
basketball isn't all about dunking.

857
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:39,981
It's about teamwork.

858
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:58,063
Hello? What? They want Jie back?

859
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,035
What contract? It's just an agreement!

860
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,774
Okay, but we'll talk about the money later.

861
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,209
I'm busy. I'm off to celebrate!

862
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:08,473
That's it, bye!

863
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,246
What a snub!

864
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,054
What the hell is it?

865
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:17,683
Boss, remember our bet, 5 million?

866
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,387
Who asked you to bet...

867
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:20,822
You won't get away with it.

868
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:26,765
Sonny is over there.

869
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:11,978
Please sign it. Again, please.

870
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:13,472
Thank you.

871
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:14,841
You looked so cool in the match.

872
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:15,910
Thank you.

873
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,313
Sorry, I ran out of ink.

874
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:19,214
Never mind.

875
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,548
The autograph looks exactly like his.

876
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:27,924
Who are you?

877
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:29,560
I'm a fan of yours!

878
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:33,863
This handwriting looks very familiar.

879
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,127
Very neat.

880
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:38,164
I seem to have seen it somewhere before?

881
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:42,036
Sure, in the letter
your Masters gave you...

882
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:48,512
What's up?

883
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,179
You're not happy with it?

884
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:54,449
Would your Masters have come
if I hadn't written the letter?

885
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,953
If they hadn't come,
would you have won the game?

886
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,556
If you didn't win the game,
how would you become famous?

887
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,249
Hey, are you leaving?

888
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,559
Okay, anyway, sooner or later,
you'll be leaving...

889
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,026
- That's what people do to me
when they become famous. - Hey,

890
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,256
can't I just go for a pee?

891
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,737
I knew it... you care about people.
You know what?

892
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,497
I noticed that your ear lobe
was so thick the time I first met you.

893
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,800
So I knew... you care about people.

894
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,443
Excuse me. Which one is Fang Shijie?

895
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,048
Wang Yiwuan!

896
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,779
His birth father is the richest man
in Asia? Wang Yiwuan!

897
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,125
Choose a nice suit. You look so shabby.

898
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,156
How can you go to meet
your father like that?

899
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:42,168
How about this one?

900
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,234
It looks pricey? How about this one?

901
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,329
How pricey can it be? Just a suit.

902
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,399
Wow, so expensive, 26000 dollars!

903
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:54,344
Never mind, count it as my gift to you.

904
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:58,079
A gift for me?

905
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,884
Yeah, the last one.

906
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,049
Oh, you're a poor man now

907
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,419
but you'll be rich tomorrow.

908
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:06,116
You'll have too much money to spend.

909
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,624
Will you still need gifts by then?

910
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:11,628
You're so good to me.

911
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,698
Don't be so naive.

912
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,332
I always treat you as a cash cow.

913
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:20,869
Moreover,

914
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:23,168
there are lots of greedy people
like me out there.

915
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:27,212
Never trust other people
when you're rich. Be smart!

916
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,046
Try it on, quick.

917
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,149
Do I look good?

918
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:33,344
Of course you do. Such a pricey suit.

919
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:34,653
I'll try it on then.

920
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:36,855
Why did we stop at this shop?

921
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:38,381
Should have gone further.

922
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,391
This damned shop! This is extortion!

923
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:02,346
I left this glass ball with you.

924
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:09,717
So it would prove that you're my son.

925
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,094
Sonny...

926
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,065
Why did you abandon me?

927
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,175
I was bankrupt in those days.

928
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,375
My creditors were after me all the time.

929
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:37,249
For your safety,

930
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:43,187
I had to leave you, my dearest son...

931
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,151
I didn't want you to be dragged
into my problems.

932
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,003
Sonny,

933
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,938
come over. Let me have a look of you.

934
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,812
Go, money is coming to you.

935
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:25,164
I owed too much to you.

936
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,635
I plan to take you to London tomorrow.

937
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:37,607
I want to declare you as my heir

938
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,312
in the Capital of Finance.

939
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,864
I have so much to tell you.

940
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,234
So much to talk about.

941
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,469
Come to the study with me.

942
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,500
You look listless.

943
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,566
If you're thinking of Jie,
why don't you go see him?

944
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:45,830
He's in a different world now.

945
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:51,708
He has a new life and new friends.

946
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:55,676
Don't greet him next time you see him.

947
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,251
He's very different now.

948
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,948
You didn't eat anything all day.

949
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:04,086
Let me get you something to eat.

950
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:34,186
Drinking alone?

951
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,133
A '92 mixed with a '94?

952
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:52,069
Wrong! It's a '02 with a '82.
Really pricey stuff.

953
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,273
I thought you'd gone to London
with your dad?

954
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:58,934
It suits me better here.

955
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:02,106
Idiot!

956
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:06,149
Why didn't you leave?

957
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:12,926
I'm waiting here for someone.

958
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,666
He coaxed me into playing basketball.

959
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:28,234
He wanted me to become famous
so I could be his cash cow.

960
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:31,335
But I know he's not a bad guy.

961
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:36,383
He just pins all his hopes on me.

962
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,143
And that has changed me.

963
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:42,048
And that has changed me.

964
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:50,354
The guy you're talking about
is a born loser.

965
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:52,733
He loses in everything all his life.

966
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:56,727
When he was about to give up his life,

967
01:32:58,372 --> 01:32:59,703
he came across a baby.

968
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:06,139
This baby brought back not only his life

969
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:08,643
but also his pride.

970
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:15,289
Thank you.

971
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:37,537
Can I keep playing basketball for you?

972
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:45,346
Basketball?
Useless... get ready for the Olympics.

973
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,020
get ready for the Olympics.
I'll send the submission to the committee.

974
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,351
High jump, long jump, javelin throw,

975
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,222
shot put, pole vault...

976
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,862
I think you can get at least
ten gold medals.

977
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:58,496
- Maybe archery as well.
- Really?

978
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,690
Of course. You're a Kung Fu kid!

979
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,664
Yeah, I forgot I knew Kung Fu.

980
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:03,802
I can swim as well.

981
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,174
We can easily earn millions of dollars
just from advertising.

982
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,976
Cheers! Here's to our grand plan.

983
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:16,214
Cheers!

984
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,584
When you have earned tons of money,

985
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,516
you can be a movie star or a singer.

986
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:22,817
Write some good songs and...

987
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:24,252
- make a lot of money!
- But I can't sing...

988
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:27,049
I'll take you on a space trip.

989
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:28,819
- Space?
- No paparazzi there.

990
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:30,330
Paparazzi?

991
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:31,363
That's it.

992
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:33,499
The end of the story
of my search for my parents.

993
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,928
My four Masters became famous
after the match.

994
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:38,265
But you've not heard of

995
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,940
the history between them
and Headmaster Wang Biao

996
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:42,937
before the match

997
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:47,278
So, you're the 'World No 1 Fist God'!

998
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:49,745
No, no... that was long time ago...

999
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,474
Not worth mentioning it at all...

1000
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,711
I'd like to take this chance

1001
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:56,754
to fight Headmaster Wang Biao

1002
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,619
If I lose, I'll join you immediately.

1003
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:02,295
Fantastic, it's so easy!

1004
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:03,258
Headmaster Wang...

1005
01:35:04,231 --> 01:35:06,028
No, no... I've sworn that

1006
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:08,292
I'd leave the world of martial arts
and never fight again.

1007
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:10,732
Okay. See you at the basketball court.

1008
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:12,631
- Come on.
- Come on.

1009
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,101
Wang Biao, if you keep finding excuses,

1010
01:35:17,311 --> 01:35:19,245
you'll be punished even more.

1011
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:23,574
Stop!

1012
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,787
Who comes first?
I'll finish him off as soon as possible.

1013
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,573
We've been friends, right?
Please don't be too heavy-handed...

1014
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:52,511
Don't worry, I won't be heavy-handed...

1015
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,505
I'll just finish you off.

1016
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,320
And Lily...

1017
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,123
She finally said to me:

1018
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,187
When are you going to treat me
to an ice cream?
